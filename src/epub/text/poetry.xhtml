			<p>
				<span>The cold storms of winter shall chill him no more,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His woes and his sorrows, his pains are all o’er;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The sod of the valley now covers his form,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He is safe in his last home, he feels not the storm.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The poor slave is laid all unheeded and lone,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where the rich and the poor find a permanent home;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not his master can rouse him with voice of command;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He knows not, he hears not, his cruel demand.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Not a tear, not a sigh to embalm his cold tomb,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>No friend to lament him, no child to bemoan;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not a stone marks the place, where he peacefully lies,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The earth for his pillow, his curtain the skies.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Poor slave! shall we sorrow that death was thy friend,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The last, and the kindest, that heaven could sead?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The grave to the weary is welcomed and blest;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And death, to the captive, is freedom and rest.</span>

			<p>
				<span>Oh! mother, weep not, though our lot be hard,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And we are helpless—God will be our guard:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For He our heayenly guardian doth not sleep;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He watches o'er us—mother, do not weep.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And grieve not for that dear loved home no more;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Our sufferings and our wrongs, ah! why deplore?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For though we feel the stern oppressor’s rod,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yet he must yield, as well as we, to God.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Torn from our home, our kindred and our friends,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And in a stranger’s land our days to end,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>No heart feels for the poor, the bleeding slave;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>No arm is stretched to rescue, and to save.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Oh! ye who boast of Freedom's sacred claims,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Do ye not blush to see our galling chains;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To hear that sounding word—'that all are free'—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When thousands groan in hopeless <em>slavery</em>?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Upon your land it is a cruel stain—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Freedom, what art thou?—nothing but a name.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>No more, no more! Oh God, this cannot be;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thou to thy children’s aid wilt surely flee:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In thine own time deliverance thou wilt give,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And bid us rise from slavery, and live.</span>

				<span>The friends we've loved, the home we’ve left,</span>

				<span>From all he lov’d— from all that life</span>

				<span>His is a sorrow deeper far,</span>

				<span>The mother, wife, or child he loved,</span>

			<p>
				<span>A feeling of deep wretchedness</span>

				<span class="i1">Comes o’er his troubled soul;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The thoughts of home,—of other days,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In painful visions roll.</span>

			<p>
				<span>His home—ah! that lov’d name recalls</span>
