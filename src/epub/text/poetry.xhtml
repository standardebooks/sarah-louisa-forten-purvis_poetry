			<h2 epub:type="title">The Grave of the Slave</h2>
			<p>
				<span>The cold storms of winter shall chill him no more,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His woes and his sorrows, his pains are all o’er;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The sod of the valley now covers his form,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He is safe in his last home, he feels not the storm.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The poor slave is laid all unheeded and lone,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where the rich and the poor find a permanent home;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not his master can rouse him with voice of command;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He knows not, he hears not, his cruel demand.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Not a tear, not a sigh to embalm his cold tomb,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>No friend to lament him, no child to bemoan;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not a stone marks the place, where he peacefully lies,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The earth for his pillow, his curtain the skies.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Poor slave! shall we sorrow that death was thy friend,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The last, and the kindest, that heaven could sead?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The grave to the weary is welcomed and blest;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And death, to the captive, is freedom and rest.</span>

			<p>
				<span>Oh! mother, weep not, though our lot be hard,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And we are helpless—God will be our guard:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For He our heayenly guardian doth not sleep;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He watches o'er us—mother, do not weep.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And grieve not for that dear loved home no more;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Our sufferings and our wrongs, ah! why deplore?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For though we feel the stern oppressor’s rod,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yet he must yield, as well as we, to God.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Torn from our home, our kindred and our friends,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And in a stranger’s land our days to end,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>No heart feels for the poor, the bleeding slave;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>No arm is stretched to rescue, and to save.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Oh! ye who boast of Freedom's sacred claims,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Do ye not blush to see our galling chains;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To hear that sounding word—'that all are free'—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When thousands groan in hopeless <em>slavery</em>?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Upon your land it is a cruel stain—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Freedom, what art thou?—nothing but a name.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>No more, no more! Oh God, this cannot be;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thou to thy children’s aid wilt surely flee:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In thine own time deliverance thou wilt give,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And bid us rise from slavery, and live.</span>

			<p>
				<span>The friends we've loved, the home we’ve left,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Will ofttimes claim a tear;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And though of these we are bereft,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Still memory makes them dear.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And deep we feel each trifling ill,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Each sorrow of the soul:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But care we for the painful thrill,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That o'er some breasts doth roll?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Poor Afric’s son—ah! he must feel</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">How hard it is to part</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From all he lov’d— from all that life</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had twined around his heart.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>His is a sorrow deeper far,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Than all that we ean show;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His is a lasting grief, o'er which</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">No healing balm can flow.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The mother, wife, or child he loved,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He ne’er shall see again;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To him they're lost—ay, dead indeed:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">What for him doth remain?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>A feeling of deep wretchedness</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Comes o’er his troubled soul;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The thoughts of home,—of other days,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In painful visions roll.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>His home—ah! that lov’d name recalls</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">All that was dear to him;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But <em>these</em> were scenes he'll know no more,—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He only <em>feels</em> they've been.</span>

			<p>
				<span>This sacred right none are denied,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Which makes the soul to Christ allied;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Man bends the heart and bows the knee,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And knows in prayer that he is free.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Yes, free to ask of Him, whate’er</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The fainting heart alone can cheer;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To worship at that holy shrine,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where beams thy Spirit, Lord, divine.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And Afric’s children they are free,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To breathe their vows, their prayers to Thee;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With thought of future joy and gain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The slave forgets his grief and pain;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Forgets awhile his slavish fear;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Forgets,—that fetters bind him here;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And in that sweet communion rest</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His hopes, his fears,—for he is blest.</span>
