			<h2 epub:type="title">The Grave of the Slave</h2>
			<p>
				<span>The cold storms of winter shall chill him no more,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His woes and his sorrows, his pains are all oâ€™er;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The sod of the valley now covers his form,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He is safe in his last home, he feels not the storm.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The poor slave is laid all unheeded and lone,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where the rich and the poor find a permanent home;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not his master can rouse him with voice of command;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He knows not, he hears not, his cruel demand.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Not a tear, not a sigh to embalm his cold tomb,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>No friend to lament him, no child to bemoan;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not a stone marks the place, where he peacefully lies,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The earth for his pillow, his curtain the skies.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Poor slave! shall we sorrow that death was thy friend,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The last, and the kindest, that heaven could sead?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The grave to the weary is welcomed and blest;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And death, to the captive, is freedom and rest.</span>
